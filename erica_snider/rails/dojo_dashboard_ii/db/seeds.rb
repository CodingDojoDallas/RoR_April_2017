# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 7.times {Dojo.create(branch: "CD #{Faker::Address.city_prefix} #{Faker::Address.city}", street: Faker::Address.street_address, city: Faker::Address.city, state: Faker::Address.state_abbr)}
